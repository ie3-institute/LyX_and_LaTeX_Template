# User's Guide

## Getting Started

The user's guide is here to give you a basic rundown of all the things you need to know to get you up and running. We will give you some information on how to install and setup Lyx, MikTeX, and the template itself. We will also give you some tips and tricks on how to use the template effectively.

## Installation

### Lyx
To install Lyx, you can go to the [Lyx website](https://www.lyx.org/Download) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### MikTeX
To install MikTeX, you can go to the [MikTeX website](https://miktex.org/download) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### Alternative: Overleaf for Collaborative Work
For group projects, we recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as an alternative editor. Overleaf is a collaborative online LaTeX editor that allows multiple people to work on the same document simultaneously in real-time. This makes it particularly useful for team-based work where you need to coordinate changes and maintain a single version of your document.

### Template
To use the template, you can download the files by clicking on the green button "<> Code" and then "Download ZIP". Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to a location of your choice. You can then open the main Lyx file in the extracted folder to start working with the template.
