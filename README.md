# LyX_and_LaTeX_Template

This is a template for scientific reports and theses using the LaTeX typesetting system. The template is available in two formats: LyX and LaTeX. LyX is a free WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editor that generates LaTeX code, which is then converted to a PDF file.

The main files are used in the editor LyX. There are two subfolders with LaTeX files, which are tested with ShareLaTeX.

## Typography

This template uses STIX fonts (https://www.stixfonts.org/) for the main body text. The cover page uses Nimbus Sans L for visual distinction. These font choices ensure professional scientific typesetting and readability.

## Quality Assurance

This template emphasizes the importance of quality assurance in your work. For experimental work, this could involve comparing experimental results with simulations. For constructive or planning tasks, quality assurance can be achieved through structured problem-solving methods. For example, if the task is to select the "best" product from many options, conducting a utility analysis ensures the quality of your work.
